## Diagnosis		
The fluent IDs in about:networking are quite generic. They should all be prefixed with about-networking-.
This will allow these ids to belong to the about:networking namespace

## Solution 
It involves changing the IDs in files toolkit/content/aboutNetworking.xhtml and /toolkit/locales/en-US/toolkit/about/aboutNetworking.ftl so they match.
The matching key word ids between these files will be prefixed with about-networking-

### Before Fix


### After Fix


## Testing Procedure 		
- Test if FireFox still builds  `./mach build` 	
- Open about:networking to check that everything looks good
